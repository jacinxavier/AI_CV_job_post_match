        "\n",
        "This notebook implements **SmartMatch**, an AI system that automatically compares a candidate’s CV with multiple job descriptions to determine the best-fit positions. The approach combines semantic similarity (using sentence embeddings) with skill-level matching (using Named Entity Recognition).\n",

        "### Pipeline Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Library Setup**  \n",
        "  Imports core libraries: `pandas`, `transformers`, `scikit-learn`, and supporting NLP/embedding utilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Model Loading**  \n",
        "  Loads a pre-trained **SentenceTransformer** model to convert job descriptions and CVs into dense vector embeddings for semantic comparison.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Data Loading**  \n",
        "  Loads job descriptions from a `.csv` file and reads a user-uploaded CV file (PDF) using text extraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Embedding Generation**  \n",
        "  Computes vector embeddings for each job description and the extracted CV using the sentence transformer.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Semantic Scoring**  \n",
        "  Calculates **cosine similarity** between the CV vector and each job description vector to measure content relevance and contextual overlap. Computes similarity score based on results\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Skill Extraction with NER and Skills Scoring**  \n",
        "  Applies a fine-tuned Hugging Face **NER model** (`algiraldohe/lm-ner-linkedin-skills-recognition`) to extract technical, technology-related, and soft skills from both the CV and job descriptions.\n",
        "  Compares extracted skils and computes a skill match score based on overlapping and missing skills.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Final Weighted score**  \n",
        "  Computed weighted score appling 90% weight to similarity score and 10% weight to skills score, so that the final results reflect an individual weight to technical skills gaps within the positions\n",
        "\n",
        "- **LLM-powered written feedback**  \n",
        "  Uses Gemini to generate written feedback regarding the semantic fit between the CV and job descriptions, in addition to factors that the user can improve/highlight on its CV to improve job score.\n"
